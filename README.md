Some bit manipulation techniques/tricks seem useful to implement in my code, so I want to be more comfortable with bit manipulation. This repo will be a place for me to dump my notes.

# Basics

### operators

| operation                       ||
| :----------------------: | :---: |
| &         | Bitwise AND          | 
| \|        | Bitwise OR           | 
| ~         | Bitwise NOT          | 
| ^         | Bitwise XOR          | 
| <<        | left shift           | 
| >>        | right shift          |
| >>>       | unsigned right shift |
